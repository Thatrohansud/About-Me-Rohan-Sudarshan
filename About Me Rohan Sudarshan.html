    <div style="background-color: aliceblue; padding: 20px;"><p>My name is Rohan Sudarshan and I am based out of Dublin, California. I have lived in Dublin for 7 years and have obtained my education both at Dublin and Emerald High. I plan on Majoring in Computer Science which is why this class is very important to me. My career goals include starting my own company and graduating a top tier university. Some other career goals include creating a major website as part of my company.</p>
        
    <p>In relation to this career I have many leadership characteristics, I have done martial arts for 6 years where I had risen to the rank of assisstant instructor and help teach the class. I also had leadership in band in middle school. I plan on starting my own club which also ties in to leadership characteristics. I major personal quality of mine is dedication and perserverance where I have pushed myself to excel in band, martial arts, and now sports. I also have experience coding in the past where I have attended many code schools and camps over the summer.</p>

    <p>Some important achievments in my life have been recieving a third degree black belt in tae-kwon-do, making all state jazz which is a prestigous honor in the music commitee, and excelling in football and other sports. I have learned that I work best under pressure and when I put my mind to something I make it happen. I really don't like being at the bottom or being bad at something so I work really hard to get good at whatever I put my mind to.</p>
